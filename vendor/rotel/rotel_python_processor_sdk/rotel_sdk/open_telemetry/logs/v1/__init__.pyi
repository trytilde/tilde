    Time when the event was observed by the collection system.

For events originating externally and collected by OpenTelemetry (e. g. using Collector) this is the time when OpenTelemetry's code observed the event measured by the clock of the OpenTelemetry code. This field MUST be set once the event is observed by OpenTelemetry.
    For converting OpenTelemetry log data to formats that support only one timestamp or when receiving OpenTelemetry log data by recipients that support only one timestamp internally the following logic is recommended:
    Use time_unix_nano if it is present, otherwise use observed_time_unix_nano.
