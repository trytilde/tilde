/// Trait that Rust processors must implement.
///
/// Modify telemetry data in place. Default implementations do nothing.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics in processor methods are caught by the `export_processor!` macro
/// before they can cross the FFI boundary. If a panic occurs, the telemetry
/// data passes through in whatever state it was in at the time of the panic
/// (potentially partially modified), and an error is printed to stderr.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use rotel_rust_processor_sdk::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Default)]
/// pub struct MyProcessor;
///
/// impl RotelProcessor for MyProcessor {
///     fn process_spans(
///         &self,
///         spans: &mut RResourceSpans,
///         _context: &ROption<RRequestContext>,
///     ) {
///         for scope_spans in spans.scope_spans.iter_mut() {
///             for span in scope_spans.spans.iter_mut() {
///                 span.attributes.push(RKeyValue::string("processed", "true"));
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }

/// `async fn` methods and automatic runtime management via `export_async_processor!`.
///
/// The host invokes these methods via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, so blocking is safe.
///
/// Processing methods return `ROption`: `RSome(result)` on success, `RNone` on panic.
/// This allows the host to reliably detect panics and optionally preserve original data.

///
/// Implement this trait to build async-capable processors. The `export_async_processor!`
/// macro handles runtime creation and bridges your async methods to the FFI boundary
/// automatically — you never need to manage a tokio runtime yourself.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// - `start()` is called once when the processor is loaded (before any processing)
/// - `shutdown()` is called when the pipeline is shutting down
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use rotel_rust_processor_sdk::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Default)]
/// pub struct MyProcessor;
///
/// impl AsyncProcessor for MyProcessor {
///     async fn process_spans(
///         &self,
///         mut spans: RResourceSpans,
///         _context: ROption<RRequestContext>,
